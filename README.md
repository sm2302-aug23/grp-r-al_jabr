Analysis of Collatz Conjecture
================

#### By Al Jabr

## Project Description

The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical conjecture concerning a
sequence defined as follows. Start with any positive integer. Then each
term is obtained from the previous term according to these rules:

If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous
term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
term plus 1.

The conjecture is that no matter what value of , the sequence will
always reach 1.
